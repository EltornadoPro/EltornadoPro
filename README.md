HII i'm EltornadoPro(grammer)
I am studying C++ programming at the UTN of Pacheco and I study Python and English on my own.
I'm a lover of video games and coffee obviously, and I also love winter.
I have been passionate about technology since I was very young, so much so that I discovered the world of programming and at this moment I am in search of my strong or main language.
If I create projects I will be showing them greetings!
